# WoW_Personality_Test
CS106 Final Project

How it works:
Eight personality questions are asked, each answer to every question gives you a point towards either the Tank class, Healer class, or the Warrior class. 
Points are tallied up as the questions are being asked, and your character class is assigned based on the final tally. (In case of a tie, a bonus question is given.) 
The image of your character is then displayed in a new JFrame panel window, and your statistics are printed to the console window.​

Main Data Structures Used:
Inheritance - Character superclass, Tank, Warrior, and Healer subclasses.​
ArrayList - Used to store questions asked on the personality test.​

Challenges We Faced:
Time - Obviously, getting things done before a certain deadline adds a little bit of pressure.​
Putting our thoughts into action - Knew what we wanted to do for the most part, but took a little bit longer actually writing the code for it all.​
Working with the JFrame - Had to look up a few things, such as how to "hotlink" the URL of an image to get it to show up in the JFrame window.​

What We Would Add If We Had More Time:
More subclasses - To narrow down the user's personality type as related to a World of Warcraft character even more.​
Character ability adjustment - A program to allow the user to change his or her character's statistics/abilities range, based on a point system where a base number of points for each ability is assigned to each character. The user would then get a remaining number of points to add to their character's abilities.​
Visual statistics representation - Adding the statistics and character name to the JFrame window​
